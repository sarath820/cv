<!-- the above is template ,it is divided into head and body ,the top most
 tag doctype tells what version of html is used ,meta tag does function like
 including description about website ,authour name etc it has many
 attributes one of them is charset which specifies which encoding system used
 here utf8 used most of time utf 8 is used,title tag includes title
 of website ,rohith blog is title of website -->

 <!-- p tag makes a sentence into paragraogh-->

 <!--img tag is used to attach image ,alt atribute is used to indicate
    visiters about image if browser cannot fetch  image ,to attach
    image we should either type image link or we can type file
    name of image in above code we used file name ,if the image
    file is in same folder as our html file then we type simply
    sarath.jpg but we placed this image in seperate folder hence
    we should include folder name in front along with slash here image
    is folder name-->
